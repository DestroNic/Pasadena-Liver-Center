                        <p>The gold standard for determining the extent of liver damage was through a liver biopsy. The procedure for a liver biopsy involves inserting a needle in between the ribs over the liver and extracting a small portion of the liver.  That piece is then reviewed under a microscope and the extent of liver injury is evaluated. This is known as Fibrosis which has 4 stages.  Stage 4 is cirrhosis or hardening of the liver. However, we have new technology that is able to place a probe over the liver. The stage of Fibrosis is determined without having to remove a piece of liver. This is non-invasive and causes no bodily harm to the patient. This technology is known as Fibro-Scan and uses transient elastography to measure liver stiffness. We have this technology at Pasadena Liver Center. The procedure takes about 15 minutes. The Patient needs to be fasting for 3 hours. This procedure is covered by most insurance and HMO’s.</p>
